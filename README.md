# My 4 Favorite Ruby Methods

### `Arrays, Shovel`
This method adds a new item to the last index of an array.

```
cats = ["Lil Bub", "Maru", "Luna", "General Mao"]
```
```
cat << "Felix"
```
```
cats = ["Lil Bub", "Maru", "Luna", "General Mao", "Felix"]
```

### `String, Print`
This method displays results of evaluating Ruby code but does not put a new line after executing.

```
print "Hello, World!"
```

### `Floats, Round`
This method rounds decimal numbers to the nearest integer.

```
.75.round #=> 1
```

### `Integers, Even`
This method checks if a number is even.

```
7.even? #=> false
```

```
10.even? #=> true
```
